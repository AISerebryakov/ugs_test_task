## Start docker-compose

For start docker-compose need from root directory of this repository call:
```bash 
  docker-compose up
```

For finish call:

```bash 
  docker-compose down
```

At start docker-compose need some time for initialize db. 

## Import Postman config

For the api test, I suggest using Postman. 
For this need import [Postman config](UGC%20Test%20Task.postman_collection.json) to desktop application.

## HTTP API

For creating objects use POST method but for getting GET.
For POST requests parameters sending as json object in request body. For GET requests as url parameters.

In reply on each request comes json object with fields `error`, `warning`, `data`. 
The `data` field can contain one object or an array of objects. It depends on the result. 
For example to fetch a list of companies this will be an array.

Available ports:

* 8000 - main port for api.
* 8001 - debug port for pprof and Statviz.
* 8003 - port for metrics.

### Constraints

* limit - max 100 objects. 
* offset - max 1000 objects.

### Error

| Field | Type | Description |
| ------------- | --- | ------------- |
| `title` | `string` | `title` contain type of the error. |
| `msg` | `string` | `msg` contain description of the error. |

Example in response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "title": "encoding_json_error",
    "msg": "error on encoding response to json"
  },
  "warning": null,
  "data": null
}
```

### Warning

The warning indicate that request executed with some kind of constraints. 
The most common that `objects_limit_exceeded`. It indicates that in response returned max amount objects.

| Field | Type | Description |
